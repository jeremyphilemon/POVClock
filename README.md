# POVClock
An arduino code to implement a Presistance of Vision (POV) Clock using 5 LEDs.

> POVCLock Turns the five LEDs on with respect to the 5x5 grid pattern for the respective numbers of the clock for 50 millisecond, then off for 50 milliseconds second, repeatedly.
  This code was debugged using an Arduino Pro Mini 5V 16MHz with the LEDs connected to the pins 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Currently, Only manual input of time works.
